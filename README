gomods
======

An index of Go modules referenced on my domain [0].
The index is a set of static HTML documents generated using the SVGU [1] tool
which is then hosted on a Web server.


Usage
-----

Note: Apart from modifying the configuration, this project is not meant to be
used manually. Instead, everything is automated within CI/CD.

The configuration for the index is done within the svgu.sky file, which is a
Starlark [2] document. Everything it written based upon the SVGU API [3].

To build the index, you need to install SVGU [1], Node.js [4] and NPM [5].
Then, it is a matter of running the command:

  npm run build

A static set of HTML documents will be available inside a "dist" directory.
